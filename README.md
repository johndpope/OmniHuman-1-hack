# Status
I focus here - it's using wan2.1 architecture as base model to train seaweed.
https://seaweed-apt.com/ - this work would yield a distilled teacher / student diffusion in 1 step.


https://github.com/johndpope/OmniHuman-1-hack/blob/main/SeaweedAPT/Wan2.1/wan.py

I believe the seaweed derived from sd3.5 but that model is slightly off only 32 layers - not 36.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
# you need to agree to ts and cs
git clone https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium models
python seaweed.py
```


UPDATE 1. 
I throw hunyuan code at claude 3.7 and ask it to rearchictect things - 


UPDATE 2. 
It seems Wan2.1 is more promising match.



Understanding the Key Components
First, let's look at the key components we need to adapt:

Base Model Architecture: Seaweed APT uses a 36-layer MMDiT with 8B parameters, while Wan appears to be a transformer-based model with similar scale (using a 36-layer transformer with 8B parameters for T2V-14B variant).
Adversarial Post-Training (APT) Process:

Deterministic distillation to initialize the one-step generator
Adversarial training with a discriminator derived from the original model
Custom discriminator architecture with cross-attention blocks at specific layers
Approximated R1 regularization for stability


Training Protocol:

Two-phase training: first on images, then on videos
Specific batch sizes, learning rates, and update counts



Adapting Seaweed's APT to Wan
Here's my proposed approach for rearchitecting Seaweed using Wan:
1. Base Model Preparation
Wan seems to be an ideal candidate for adaptation because:

It operates on a similar scale (8B parameters)
It's a transformer-based model (using WanModel)
It supports both text-to-video and image-to-video generation
It has similar transformer block structures that can be modified for discriminator use

Use the Wan T2V-14B variant as the base model, which has the full 36-layer transformer and 8B parameters matching Seaweed's scale.





### Functional Specification: OmniHuman Recreation



#### Overview
The OmniHuman system is a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework designed for scalable, end-to-end human video generation conditioned on multiple modalities (text, audio, pose, and reference images). It aims to produce highly realistic human animations supporting various input types (e.g., portrait, half-body, full-body), aspect ratios, and styles, while excelling in gesture generation and object interaction. The system leverages a novel "omni-conditions" training strategy to maximize data utilization and scalability.

This spec outlines the components required to recreate OmniHuman, focusing on modularity and functionality without implementation details.
